# Journey of Engineering

## Introduction

It is quite impressive that a lot of engineers have been appearing for the past few years, making millions of products every year, serving the needs of billions of people. But, are all of them good engineers? Do they learn things in the right way? Do they explore the things they are working with? Do they understand what they are doing exactly? The answer to it, for most engineers today, is no.

Note that I certainly do not consider myself a perfect person or engineer. But this document isn’t about me or from me. It’s from the people that I learned from, the people who are great in this industry, the people who put the foundations of engineering from 1000 years B.C. to 21st century. I’ll be mentioning their names in the document itself wherever necessary.

This document will have multiple chapters that will only contain the abstract of what should be done in that step. Consider each chapter as a step of learning. In each chapter learning resources will be mentioned, and the references and guidance will be there, but one thing won’t, and that is the knowledge itself. It must explored, learned, and noted by the individual himself. That is the core of this document that the knowledge must only be gathered by the one who wants it because it is not the things that you learn, it is the process.

Every chapter will have a bunch of questions you need to answer by exploring over the internet. Some chapters may require you to do physical or emulated experiments, and their results must be written and kept as a record.

### Chapter 1 - Forget Everything You Know

> "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." - Albert Einstein

For the first chapter. I want you to believe that everything you know may be wrong. I want you to always doubt what you already know. For example, If Albert Einstein had not doubted Newton’s classical physics, especially gravity, he would never have been able to make his ideas and see the universe from a different perspective.
Another example is the Wright brothers. They were not the first to make an airplane, but they were the first to make a successful one. They doubted the existing designs and made their own.

Now, just as an example I recommend this video, there is a TEDx talk by Jacob Barnett, a 14-year-old physicist.

[Forget what you know | Jacob Barnett | TEDxTeen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq-FOOQ1TpE) - YouTube

You should be reading this after watching the video. Now, I want you to write a summary of the video, and then answer these questions:

1. What is the core message of the video?
2. How can you relate the video to your life?
3. Do you need to learn more in your field or do you feel ready to think now?

Keep these answers with you, we may need them in the future. I don't need to know the answers it's only you who is going to get benefit from them. Most of the great people learnt from themselves, I don't mean entirely, but they did a lot of self-learning and exploration.

### Chapter 2 - Find Answers

> “You don’t understand anything until you learn it more than one way.” — Marvin Minsky

See, there is no single source of information. But in the modern era, the internet is where you can find almost all of your answers.

The learning is not about “how fast you find the answers?”. Instead, it is about “How deep you dig through the information?”. You should at least have more than one source for learning a single thing, and more than a dozen if you can.

Now I want you to brush up your mind by watching these videos and write/record a summary about them.

[I SUED THE SCHOOL SYSTEM (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8) - YouTube

[The Biggest Myth In Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA) - YouTube

Both of these videos may break your pre-existing beliefs.

Now, I don’t want you to just throw the education system away, instead learn from what they did wrong, make it right, implement on yourself, and spread it in the world.

That’s how humans have come so far in evolution rather than any other animal on the planet. We are good at fixing things, making them better, and passing them down to future generations. If you want to learn more and more things. I have a existing philosophy on this, you may check that out as well “The Hundred Things Principal”.
