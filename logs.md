- I will need some assistance from other people for completing this document. Although, I haven't asked anyone so far. But, I have put a request in the book and plan as well. If someone is interested, then I'll connect with him.
- So far the progress of this project is really slow, I've become DRDO in some regard. I wasn't this slow ever but I have left multiple things in half way. (eg: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mJqlaHoGW33gO5Zu1F8f1_NrHv7Yw-zVS3N3o7O2VD8/edit#heading=h.kk1966kbedef>, <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMM-z41km_-OH8P2gFwcceUY_M2iPUZoJCMPd7ZekwE/edit#heading=h.nrnw03t7conb>, <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xHND9g6NJkPufVrqU6s8ojGM9NNPTRsipWJ9UWPM2hQ/edit#heading=h.nj23sjpj5u97> and this <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrsHKzZWJ7GLV4vBnpS4UEVGJnrTayWMHvr9z0D0wl0/edit>). Although there are a some projects that I've completed too but still the ratio is bad. I am not satisfied with what I've done so far and I'll need to do more by any means.
- I'm planning to completed one of it's chapter by next week as close to 90% before the review.
- I think this doc has lost his path. Engineering isn't appearing in the book, it's just learning and improving. I'll have to split it into two docs. And `THAT IS A CHALLENGE`.
