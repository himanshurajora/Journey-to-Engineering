# Plan - Journey of Engineering

Here is the planning of JOE. It may change in future as the document is currently in development.

I am primarily writing this document/book to open the eyes of students and make them see learning, thinking and implementing solutions with a different perspective.

Currently I have thought of the following chapters.

1. Forget everything you know
One must be unbiased and open to new ideas. This chapter will introduce the reader to the concept of forgetting everything they know and start from scratch.

2. Understand the problem
This chapter will introduce the reader to the concept of understanding the problem before solving it. It will also introduce the reader to the concept of asking questions.

3. Find answers
There might be thousands of answers to a single question. One must know the process of Aggregation of answers, collecting them and analyze
later on using his own perception.

4. Filter answers
There are lot of answers but not all of them are correct. The most correct answer is typically the one that is most common.

5. Take the help of AI
Modern problems require modern solutions. AI is fairly new but not that weak to be ignored. AI can certainly save a lot of time and evaluating 
the truthiness of answers especially AIs that are trained on large datasets and real time data.

6. Find existing solutions
You might not be the first one to find the problem or solve it. There are high chances of an existing solution. Find them and look what you can do to improve them.

7. Think
Thinking is the most important part of engineering. This chapter will introduce the reader to the concept of thinking and how to think.

8. Make a solution
There are certain steps that will help you make a solution in the most efficient way. Keeping you knowledge secured and making sure that you are not missing anything.

9. Test and Evaluate
Once a solution is ready and gives an optimal result, it is time to test and evaluate it.

10. Refactor and Finalize
We miss a lot of things in the first attempt. The first iteration is almost always the most messy one. Refactor and make it better.

11. Compare
Compare your solution with the existing ones. If it's not better, go back to step 1. Yes. Forget everything you know and start from scratch.
Or if your answers is almost near to be the best. Go to step 7.
